Introduction to datasets
========================

* All filenames are named after the outbreak in the filename, or its main feature that binds the genomes together
* All datasets are in Excel format but must be converted to tsv before they are used.
* Datasets are a more rigid format which contain information on the dataset itself and also an inline table beginning with a header.
